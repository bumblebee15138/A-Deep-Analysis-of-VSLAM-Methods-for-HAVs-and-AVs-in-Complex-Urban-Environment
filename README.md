## At a Glance
An imprecise localization can greatly impact subsequent decision-making to manage an HAV or AV’s motion (planning and control tasks). In recent years, visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM) has shown substantial progress and equipping it can lead to handling non-standardized situations of real-world scenes and achieving higher localization and mapping accuracy. In this article, we present a comprehensive analysis of the current research status of VSLAM and its potential application to HAVs or AVs operating in complex urban environments. We will publish our article in the future, and more details can be found in our article.

## Some Representative Relevant Papers
As shown in the image in [At a Glance](#at-a-glance) section, VSLAM can provide effective solutions to the difficulties encountered by HAVs or AVs in complex urban environments. In this section, we provide links to some representative papers on these solutions.
